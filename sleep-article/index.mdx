# Sleep: A Practical Guide for Better Rest

Sleep isn’t just downtime; it’s the foundation for recovery, focus, and mood. This quick, practical guide covers the basics you can test for a week without overhauling your life.

## Why Sleep Quality Matters

Good sleep improves learning, reaction time, and emotional regulation. Poor sleep compounds stress and makes it harder to build consistent habits.

### Key outcomes of better sleep

- More stable energy across the day
- Faster recovery after training
- Improved memory and focus

## A Simple 7‑Day Reset

Start with small changes and track results. Keep a short note each morning: bedtime, wake time, and how rested you feel.

1. **Set a consistent wake time** (even on weekends).
2. **Get outside early** for natural light within 60 minutes of waking.
3. **Cut caffeine after lunch** to avoid delayed sleep onset.
4. **Lower lights at night** to help melatonin production.

## Common Roadblocks

- **Racing thoughts:** Try a 3‑minute brain dump before bed.
- **Late work:** Add a 15‑minute wind‑down block to separate work from sleep.
- **Overheating:** Lower the room temp or use breathable bedding.

## Conclusion

Small, consistent changes compound. Try the 7‑day reset and keep only the habits that noticeably improve how you feel.
