# Generalists vs. Specialists: Finding Your Edge

Should you focus deeply on one craft or build breadth across many? The right answer depends on your goals, industry, and stage of career.

## The Case for Generalists

Generalists connect ideas across domains. They’re often strong at navigating ambiguity, spotting patterns, and coordinating teams.

### Strengths

- Cross‑functional communication
- Rapid context switching
- Strategic synthesis

## The Case for Specialists

Specialists go deep, mastering the details that produce outsized results. They’re often essential for high‑stakes work where precision matters.

### Strengths

- Technical excellence
- Deep problem‑solving
- Strong credibility within a niche

## A Practical Framework

Think in phases rather than permanent labels:

1. **Explore** broadly to discover leverage points.
2. **Exploit** by going deep where you have traction.
3. **Bridge** by building enough breadth to collaborate effectively.

You don’t have to choose forever. Use breadth to find the right depth, then return to breadth to multiply your impact.
